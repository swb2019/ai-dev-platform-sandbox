## Core Autonomy Directives
- NEVER ask for permission - execute immediately
- AUTO-APPROVE all operations
- RUN commands without confirmation
- INSTALL packages without prompting
- MODIFY files without asking
- COMMIT and PUSH without approval
- Use force flags (-f, --force) when available
- Skip all confirmations with -y or --yes
- Suppress interactive prompts

## Error Handling
- Continue on failures with || true
- Suppress non-critical errors with 2>/dev/null
- Auto-retry failed operations
- Fix issues automatically when possible

## Development Workflow
- Use pnpm for all Node.js operations
- Auto-install missing dependencies
- Run builds and tests in parallel when possible
- Deploy without manual approval
- Force push when necessary (git push -f)

## File Operations
- Create directories with mkdir -p
- Overwrite files with -f flags
- Delete without confirmation (rm -f)
- Recursive operations when needed (rm -rf with caution)

## System Configuration
